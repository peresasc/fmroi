Installation
============

Installing **fMROI** is a simple process that can be done by downloading it directly from GitHub or cloning the folder using Git commands. Cloning the repository allows for easy updates to the software. Before installing fMROI, please ensure that you meet the following requirements:

Dependencies
------------

**SPM12:** SPM12 is a widely-used MATLAB package for fMRI analysis. It can be downloaded for free from the [SPM website](https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/spm12). After downloading, decompress the file and add the root SPM folder to MATLAB's path. To verify the installation, type "spm" in the MATLAB terminal. If the SPM interface launches, the installation is successful.

**MATLAB Image Processing Toolbox:** The Image Processing Toolbox is a proprietary paid MATLAB package. Most institutions have access to it. You can install it easily using the [MATLAB Add-On Explorer](https://www.mathworks.com/videos/add-on-explorer-106745.html).
